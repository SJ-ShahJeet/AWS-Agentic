Looking at your AutoOps system, here's a simple database schema that supports the core functionality:

## Core Tables

**employees**
- id (primary key)
- name
- role (manager | employee)
- hire_date
- status (active | inactive)
- created_at
- updated_at

**shifts**
- id (primary key)
- employee_id (foreign key → employees.id)
- scheduled_start
- scheduled_end
- actual_start (nullable)
- actual_end (nullable)
- status (scheduled | in_progress | completed | cancelled | no_show)
- created_at
- updated_at

**shift_callouts**
- id (primary key)
- shift_id (foreign key → shifts.id)
- employee_id (foreign key → employees.id)
- reason (text, nullable)
- replacement_employee_id (foreign key → employees.id, nullable)
- resolved_at (nullable)
- created_at

**onboarding_plans**
- id (primary key)
- employee_id (foreign key → employees.id)
- training_checklist (json/text)
- status (in_progress | completed)
- created_at
- completed_at (nullable)

**feedback**
- id (primary key)
- employee_id (foreign key → employees.id)
- submitted_by_employee_id (foreign key → employees.id)
- shift_id (foreign key → shifts.id, nullable)
- feedback_text
- rating (1-5 or similar scale)
- created_at

**performance_ratings**
- id (primary key)
- employee_id (foreign key → employees.id)
- weighted_score (decimal)
- last_calculated_at
- updated_at

**shift_payouts**
- id (primary key)
- shift_id (foreign key → shifts.id)
- employee_id (foreign key → employees.id)
- approval_status (pending | approved | rejected)
- approved_at (nullable)
- notes (text, nullable)

**agent_decisions**
- id (primary key)
- event_type (onboarding | shift_coverage | payout_approval | feedback_processing)
- related_entity_id (the shift_id, employee_id, etc.)
- decision_output (json)
- explanation (text)
- created_at

This schema keeps things simple and focused on your core use cases. The `agent_decisions` table is particularly useful for explainability and auditing what the supervisor agent decided and why.
