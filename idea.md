# AutoOps – Autonomous Employee Operations Agent

## One-liner
AutoOps is an AI-powered supervisor agent that autonomously manages employee operations such as onboarding, shift coverage, peer feedback, and shift completion with minimal manager intervention.

## Problem
Managers spend a significant amount of time handling repetitive operational decisions:
- Onboarding new employees
- Resolving shift call-outs
- Evaluating informal performance signals
- Approving completed shifts for payout

These decisions follow patterns but still require manual coordination.

## Solution
AutoOps introduces a Supervisor Agent that:
- Reacts to real-time operational events
- Delegates decisions to specialized tools
- Applies policy and performance signals
- Produces explainable outcomes

The system reduces operational overhead while maintaining transparency and human oversight.

## What Makes It Agentic
- Event-driven decision making
- Autonomous resolution of common workflows
- Policy-based reasoning instead of hard-coded rules
- Clear explanations for every decision

## Core Use Cases
1. New employee joins → onboarding plan generated
2. Employee calls out → optimal replacement selected
3. Shift completes → payout eligibility approved
4. Peer feedback submitted → performance signal updated

## Target Users
- Managers / Owners
- Hourly or shift-based employees

## Scope Boundaries
This project is intentionally scoped as:
- A decision-making layer
- A demo-ready autonomous system

It is not:
- A full HR platform
- A payroll system
- A scheduling SaaS

## Demo Narrative
An employee calls out sick, and the system autonomously resolves shift coverage, logs performance signals, and prepares payout approval without manager micromanagement.
